# Gmail-cleanup
This code automates the Gmail clean up based on your keywords &amp; emails and Logs everything in your gsheet
Automating my Gmail like a Pro — No 3rd-party tools, just Google Sheets + Apps Script!

I built a full automation system that:

📬 Auto-deletes all spam emails everyday/based on ur trigger
🛑 Removes emails from a custom blacklist (e.g., known spam or notification addresses)
🔍 Filters and deletes emails based on suspicious keywords like “win”, “bonus”, “claim”
🧾 Logs all deleted emails (sender, subject, reason, timestamp) to a Google Sheet
📅 Supports expiration dates for blacklist entries
📧 Sends me a Gmail notification summary after every cleanup

All done using:
	•	Google Apps Script (native Gmail access)
	•	Google Sheets as a dynamic backend (for blacklist + logging)
	•	A clean, no-maintenance, cost-free solution 👨‍💻

 Step1 = https://script.google.com/
 step2 = create a project and dump the provide code.js (Add your custom keywords as you like based on your usecase).
 step3 = create a gheet exactly as provided with same columns and tabs.
 step4 = run it and test it and Deploy. 
 step5 = create a trigger by clicking on the clock sign and add the project u created and choose ur settings.

 Enjoy !
